# Evaluating-Urban-Air-Quality-through-IoT-Data-Processing-Analysis

Evaluating Urban Air Quality through IoT Data Processing & Analysis (October 2023 – November 2023 | Newcastle, England)

• Developed an IoT data injector by integrating with the Newcastle Urban Observatory API,
focusing on the collection and transmission of air quality data for further processing.

• Designed and implemented a data preprocessing operator using Docker and Python, effectively
cleaning and averaging PM2.5 air quality data for machine learning training.

• Created a time-series data prediction and visualization module, employing machine learning
models for forecasting air quality and visualizing results using matplotlib
